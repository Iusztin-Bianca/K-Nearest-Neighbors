# K-Nearest-Neighbors

Project accomplished in a ML course :Python for machine learning and data science bootcamp.
We received a classified data set from a company. They've hidden the feature column names but given us the data and the target classes.
We will use K Nearest Neighbors algorithm to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features.
